# Feature Sliced Design + vite + vue

FSD (Sliced Design Feature) is a new front end architecture for large projects and this architecture is simply the best for me.

## What is FSD?

Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and structured in the face of ever-changing business requirements.
